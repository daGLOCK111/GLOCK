It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 2014, with its chapters additionally collected into 37 tankōbon volumes as of February 2023.

        <br>   
            The manga spawned a media franchise, having inspired numerous spin-off manga, such as My Hero Academia: Smash!!, My Hero Academia: Vigilantes and My Hero Academia: Team-Up Missions. The series has expanded into light novels, stage plays, and various types of merchandise and media such as a trading card game and numerous video games. It has been adapted into an anime television series produced by Bones.

It has also received three animated films, titled My Hero Academia: Two Heroes, My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising, and My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission, respectively. Additionally, it has developed eight original video animations (OVAs), each bundled with a limited edition in numerous volumes of the manga. There are plans for a live-action film by Legendary Entertainment.
        <br>    
            In North America, the manga series has been licensed by Viz Media, who published the first volume in August 2015. It was released simultaneously in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Shueisha began to simulpublish the series in English on Manga Plus online platform. The anime series has been licensed for streaming services, the home and broadcast release, and the merchandise rights by Crunchyroll. The English dub premiered on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in May 2018.
        <br>
            My Hero Academia has become a large commercial success, appearing on The New York Times bestseller list several times. By February 2023, the manga had over 85 million copies in circulation including sales of spin-offs, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Critical reception has also been positive with reviewers praising the manga for its art, characters, storytelling, action sequences and the use of pop culture references to Western superhero comics; the anime series has received additional praise for its animation, music, pacing, action sequences and voice performances in both Japanese and English. The manga and anime have both won several awards, including the Sugoi Japan Award and Harvey Award for Best Manga, and received two nominations for Anime of the Year at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards.</p>

            <h2><u>Sypnosis of My Hero Academia</u></h2>
            <p> Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. After having a few encounters with his idol, All Might, who is Japan's greatest hero, Izuku is chosen by All Might to inherit his Quirk "One For All" (which gives him the ability to endlessly stockpile his raw power) and become his successor, as All Might was severely injured by his arch-nemesis All For One (whose Quirk allows him to steal other Quirks for his use and pass them over to others at his will) and does not have much time left to live. Izuku begins attending the U.A. High School for heroes in training alongside Bakugo and his friends from Class 1-A while keeping his connection with All Might a secret. During the course of the school year, Izuku and his friends work hard to improve themselves and have a few encounters with the League of Villains led by All For One's apprentice Tomura Shigaraki, who desires to kill All Might as part of their plan to take over the world. During one of these encounters, All Might and All For One have one last fight, which ends with All For One defeated and imprisoned, and All Might, having exhausted the last of One For All's power in himself, forced to retire.
            <br>
                After passing the exam to obtain a Provisional Hero License, Izuku begins working as an intern with All Might's former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, whose Quirk gives him the power to predict the future. Sir Nighteye believes that Izuku is not worthy of inheriting One For All, but his opinion changes after Izuku helps take down the Shie Hassaikai, a gang of Quirk-enhanced yakuza and their leader Overhaul while rescuing a girl named Eri whose Quirk was being used to create a weapon that erases people's Quirks, despite he was foretold that Izuku would die in the operation. However, Sir Nighteye is mortally wounded in the occasion but passes away certain that Izuku can live up to All Might's legacy. Izuku then continues his internship under the hero Endeavor, who assumed All Might's position as Japan's top hero following his retirement, along with Bakugo and Endeavor's son, Shoto Todoroki and awakens in himself a Quirk that belonged to one of All Might's predecessors, discovering that he can eventually obtain all the Quirks of the previous users of One For All as well.
            <br>               
                Meanwhile, the League of Villains grows stronger after Shigaraki gathers more followers and defeats another villain group, the Meta Liberation Army led by Re-Destro, leading to both organizations merge into the Paranormal Liberation Front under his leadership. To counter this new threat, the Pro and Training Heroes join together in a massive operation to arrest them, but despite having several wounded and casualties, they fail to capture most of the League, including Shigaraki, who inherits All For One's Quirk and is possessed by him. In the following months, Shigaraki's group gain momentum by releasing thousands of imprisoned Villains which makes Japan descend into chaos and anarchy. Izuku, knowing that he is Shigaraki and All For One's primary target, decides that it's too dangerous for his friends and family to have him around and flees from U.A., leaving behind some letters to the others revealing all the truth.
            <br>     
                Six months later, Izuku reappears, having unlocked most of his predecessors' Quirks and reunites with his classmates, who convince him to return to U.A., which was turned into a refugee camp for the students' families and other civilians who fled from the Villains. With Shigaraki's assimilation by All For One nearly complete, America's No. 1 Pro Hero, Star and Stripe, arrives to fight him by All Might's request. However, Shigaraki manages to kill her and steal her Quirk instead but before dying, she manages to use her power to delay the assimilation process, giving the Heroes some time to devise a plan. A few days later, the heroes begin their final battle against the League of Villains, managing to separate Shigaraki from his subordinates to give Izuku (who fully awakened the power of One For All and his predecessors) the chance to fight him in a duel. </p>

            <img src="characters.jpg" alt="My Hero Academia UA Hight School Charecters" width="500" height="250" style="float: right;">
            <p>U.A. High School is a top ranking hero academy and considered as a prestigious high school for hero training in Japan. It is at the top of a forested hill in Musutafu, Japan. There are four academic tracks available to students: Hero, General, Support and Management Courses. Students who are not accepted into the Hero Course are included in the General Course. However, they can still be transferred into the Hero Course by impressing the faculty at the Sports Festival and scoring passing grades. As stated by the Class 1-A homeroom teacher Shota Aizawa, U.A. does not adhere to traditional school methods, and allows their faculty staff to teach their classes however they like. This includes teachers having the authority to expel any students and for any reason, no matter how minor. Students who are expelled can be re-enrolled, although the expulsion will remain on their permanent records</p>

            <img src="izuku.jpg" alt="Izuku Midoriya" width="150" height="400" style="float: right;">
            <p>The main protagonist of the series, Izuku, is a timid, selfless, and Quirkless teenage boy who dreams of becoming a superhero. He is initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, vulnerable, and non-expressive due to yeаrs of being looked down on Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. He is quite diligent and strong-willed student, being extremely (and sometimes scarily) enthusiastic about topics related to heroes. His dream drives him to write notes about everything he learns to regard heroes' Quirks and fighting capabilities. Thanks to this practice, Izuku has developed a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in a few seconds, factoring in the best ways he can use the Quirks of allies and enemies alike for his own advantage. He helps or lecture people with personal and emotional problems, regardless if it is his business or not, claiming that a hero should meddle in other people's lives. He externalizes his observations through endless mumbling, a habit that annoys or creeps out his peers including All Might. He has a strong fascination with heroes and is shown well-versed in their history, sometimes even surprising the heroes themselves with his vast knowledge. After attempting to save his childhood friend Bakugo from a villain, Izuku is chosen by All Might to inherit his abilities and become the ninth holder of One For All, a transferable Quirk that stockpiles power and grants him immense strength, speed, stamina, and durability.ep 3 Eventually, Izuku becomes the first user to manifest a psychic link with the spirits of past One For All users as well as inherit their Quirks. After nearly a year of school activities and internships, some of which are intercepted by villain attacks, Izuku learns that All for One's apprentice Tomura Shigaraki has become powerful enough to steal One for All. Due to this, Izuku decides to leave U.A. so he can combat Shigaraki and his army of villains without endangering his classmates, who he had informed about his leave. Prior to leaving, he informs his classmates and several of the top heroes about One for All, the latter of whom assist him in hunting down the villains.</p>

            <h3><u>Katsuki Bakugo (Hero name: Dynamite)</u></h3>
            <img src="bakugou.jpg" alt="Katsuki Bakugou" width="190" height="400" style="float: right;">
            <p>Izuku's short-fused childhood friend turned arch-rival and classmate in Class 1-A. His Quirk is Explosion which enables him to secrete sweat with nitroglycerin-like properties from his hands and ignite it on command to produce powerful explosions. The Ultra Analysis guidebook was revealed that Bakugo described his personality as an "abusive egotist". Katsuki is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series.ep 1 Because of his Quirk and talents, Katsuki is very confident and brave to where he will go against anyone who challenges him. He never backs down from a fight and will go out when facing such a powerful opponent. Because of having been excessively praised by his peers as a child for his strong Quirk and natural-born talent, Bakugo became very egotistical and disrespectful, especially towards Izuku. Both characters share a sensitive history with each other, with Katsuki being unable to overcome his issues with Izuku, although this has not stopped them from working together many times especially in Final Exams Arc. He prefers to self-reflect in silence and solitude, becoming a bit more brooding during those periods. His unchecked pride and aggression cost him victories frequently, like the Battle Trial or the Provisional Hero License Exam, and it worsens whenever Izuku is involved. Despite having bullied Izuku ever since they were kids, over the course of the series, he grows to care for Izuku's well-being, especially after learning the truth about One For All. After Izuku leaves U.A. to keep his friends and family safe from All For One, Bakugo finally mends his relationship with the former by apologizing to him for his arrogant behavior over the years and calling him by his real name.</p>

            <h3><u>Ochacho Uraraka (Hero name: Uravity)</u></h3>
            <img src="uraraka.jpg" alt="Ochacho Uraraka " width="190" height="400" style="float: right;">
            <p>A bubbly and kind-hearted girl whose Quirk Zero Gravity, enables her to make any object weightless by touching them with the pads on her fingertips. Overuse of her Quirk will cause her to suffer from severe nausea. The author Horikoshi describes Ochaco as "honest". In a prototype concept made by Horikoshi, Ochaco was originally named "Yu Takeyama" which is the full name of Mt. Lady, as well as the Quirk herself. However, this was scrapped because Horikoshi thought that it would have made her too overpowered than the protagonists and that would also be made her too troublesome to handle. Ochaco was described as "the most laid back girl" among her class. She is often incredibly blunt without being aware of it. She often becomes amused at certain personality traits and quirks others exhibit, bursting into laughter, which she tries to suppress. Ochaco is the one whom inspiring and embraces Izuku's hero name and saying that "Deku" sounds similar to "dekiru" ,which roughly translates to "[you] can do it". She is a very warm individual who thinks about everything positively, though she is objective enough to see flaws and virtues. She is empathetically friendly to those she meets, and will try to help or defend anyone who is kind to her or who needs help. Despite her usually cheery and sometimes ditzy demeanor, Ochaco can take on an extremely determined, focused, and somewhat intimidating attitude when the situation calls for it. She has a crush on Izuku, but keeps it private to focus on her goal to become a hero in order to provide for her parents. Unlike all of her classmates who are using smartphones, Ochaco still owns a flip-phone for being a poor household. In terms of heroism, Ochaco has shown more preference towards rescue, being a fan of Thirteen for her expertise in the area. She is aware of her physical limitations, deciding to choose the combat-oriented hero Gunhead for her internship in order to increase her fighting repertoire. She developed a new sense of battle awareness and has become a more instinctive fighter. After her classmates successfully bring Izuku back to U.A., when the civilians begin to protest about forcing to pay the price for the heroes' mistakes, Ochaco pleads the crowd with her speech and convinced them to let Izuku rest because Heroes deserved to be saved too.</p>

            <img src="lida.jpg" alt="Tenya Lida" width="190" height="400" style="float: right;">
            <p>The straight-laced president of Class 1-A whose Quirk Engine gives him super speed and superhuman kicking strength via jet engines in his calves. Horikoshi mentions in the first volume that Tenya was created during the serialization meeting and that the character ended up deviating from the original concept (possibly because of the setting being changed to a school one), which may explain the disparity between the older and hardly resembled the current character and the design in which it is much slimmer and not as tall or muscular. Tenya may look severe, unfriendly, and even intimidating at first glance, but he is actually a straightforward, earnest, intelligent, sophisticated, disciplined, and noble person, although clueless about personal interactions because of his elite upbringing. He takes everything seriously and is known for his habit of jumping to conclusions, then enthusiastically speaking or acting based on said conclusions; for example, after Izuku had figured out the true nature during the Entrance Exam, Tenya acknowledged him as a worthy peer and has since held him in high esteem. As Class 1-A's president, Tenya is obsessed with organization and discipline, expecting his classmates to follow suit, which more often than not annoys them because of his loud and overbearing nature. He is very humble, willing to admit to his mistakes, apologize for rude behavior, and improve himself in areas he is lacking. Being part of the highly esteemed Ida Family, Tenya is proud of his lineage and works hard to meet the expectations placed upon him. He admires his older brother Tensei, and aspires to become a hero similar to him. After his older brother Tensei was forced to retire because of being critically injured by the Hero Killer Stain, Tenya takes up his brother's mantle after much contemplation.</p>

            <img src="todoroki.jpg" alt="Shoto Todoroki" width="190" height="340" style="float: right;">
            <p>An aloof and composed student in Class 1-A. His Quirk Half-Cold Half-Hot enables him to generate ice from the right side of his body and fire from the left. He is the one student in U.A. High School that got an application through Recommendation Entrance Exam. Shoto was originally a cold, aloof personality, which stemmed from his abusive upbringing and complicated family life. Focused and unemotional, Shoto preferred to keep to himself instead of hanging out with other people. He is the youngest child of Endeavor and because of the harsh abuse that he suffered from his father growing up; he refused to use his left side for years until Izuku made him understand that using his fire powers does not mean that he has to accept his heritage. After the events of the U.A. Sports Festival, however, Shoto notably became more sociable and kind, even gaining a sense of humor and occasionally smiling, although still keeping some fragments of his previous distant attitude. He goes to visit his mother Rei Todoroki in the hospital, although the two felt awkward because of how much time they spent apart. He remains relatively cold towards Endeavor and has clarified that forgiveness for his past treatment of him and his mother is difficult, but has showed worry pertaining to his father's safety. Ever since his father tried to repair his relationship with his family, Shoto has taken a cautious, yet hopeful approach to the development.</p>
