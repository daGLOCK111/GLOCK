        <p>With season 6 ending, when will we get to see more?<p>

        <p>As DC reboots and cracks in the MCU start to show, it's easy to see why superhero fatigue is finally setting in for some audiences who might be growing tired of seeing spandex-clad vigilantes battle it out on screen.</p>
        <p>But if that's you, don't worry. There's still hope for the genre yet in the form of a mighty series named My Hero Academia.</p>
        <p>In the years since Kōhei Horikoshi's manga was first adapted in 2015, My Hero Academia has steadily become one of the most popular anime shows of all time — and with good reason, too.</p>
        <p>It's not easy to stand out in the superhero genre, but Izuku Midoriya's story has become something truly special thanks to its relatable hero and the kind of epic battles that Marvel and DC could only dream of bringing to life on screen.</p>
        <p>But you probably now that already, right? Why else would you be here?</p>
        <p>With season 6 now over (arguably the best chapter yet — fight us!), all eyes are on what's to come next for Midoriya and the rest of the Pro Heroes at UA High and beyond.</p>
        <p>Join ma as I break down everything you need to know about My Hero Academia season 7, which could very well turn out to be the final season...</p>

        <h2>Will there be a My Hero Academia season 7?</h2>
        <p>My Hero Academia's seventh season has now been confirmed. That shouldn't have come as too much of a surprise though as the story told in Kōhei Horikoshi's original manga hasn't been completed yet on screen.</p>
        <p>That means the biggest question around season 7 isn't whether it's happening or not – it's whether this will end up being the final ever season of My Hero Academia.</p> 
        <p>Given that the anime has almost caught up with the manga, this does seem likely, although Studio Bones might want to stretch things out a bit due to the franchise's colossal success. If that turns out to be the case, then a shorter season 8 could be developed to help wrap everything up.</p>            
        <p>I will keep this page updated with all the latest news on My Hero Academia season 7 when we hear more.</p>

        <h2>My Hero Academia season 7 release date speculation: When will it air?</h2>
        <p>With that all-important renewal now confirmed, an official release date for My Hero Academia season 7 should soon be on its way.</p>
        <p>Until that day comes, all we can do is speculate over a potential release date, which we reckon will could be scheduled for around April 2024.</p>
        <p>There's usually a 13-month gap between seasons, and with the latest instalment coming to an end in March 2023, that window would make a lot of sense assuming there are no delays behind the scenes. I'll keep you posted as soon as I hear more on that front.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Is there a trailer for My Hero Academia season 7?</h2>
        <p>With that all-important renewal confirmed, we're one step closer to seeing a new trailer, but it could still take some time as we're probably a year out from the show's return.</p>
        </p>We'll update this page as and when more trailers and plot details are released.</p>
